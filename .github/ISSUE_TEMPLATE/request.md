Enter a clear and concise description of what you want to happen here. Keep the length to one or two paragraphs, more specific (i.e. technical) detail can be added further on. The title of the issue should provide sufficient detail so as to easily locate the ticket in the future, and should identify the primary action item or concern.

For front-end or UI/UX requests, a Codepen proof of concept would be greatly welcome. At a minimum, a bullet-point summary can be sufficient.

# [lisp.webcore.io](http://lisp.webcore.io/)

A "hyper-minified" (but somehow, still readable and maintainable) variant of [Enichan's](https://gist.github.com/Enichan) ["interpretoy"](https://gist.github.com/Enichan/4a9fa87aef6405e13e1c072baa117beb) experimental JavaScript Lisp interpreter, initially reduced to 85% of its original size. I have a [personal](https://gist.github.com/amcgregor/71c62ea2984839a9063232ed2c0adf27) [vendetta](https://github.com/amcgregor/paste#readme) against semicolons in JS and much of HTML, and do not balk in the face of unpopular practices like assuming element attachment to the `window` object (elevation to "global variables") by ID.

This will be progressively extended for improved and more semantic presentation, while still being kept as minimal as possible.

Please reference the code (which is commented!) for details and supported features / capabilities.
